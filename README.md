There are two parts to this assignment. 
Both parts of the assignment are due by 9:00 am on Wednesday, Feb. 10. 
Please come to Prof. Gilligan or Mr. Belanger's office hours 
if you need help with the assignment.

## Part 1:

The first part of the assignment, uses the RMarkdown template, 
`lab_02_report_part_2.Rmd`, which has exercises
for downloading climate data from the internet and using various tools from the
`tidyverse` package to manipulate the data, analyze it, and plot it.
We will spend most of lab working through these exercises, and you will finish
it at home.

The file _lab_02_worked_examples.Rmd` has worked examples of the kind of code
you will be using in this lab for downloading data from the internet and 
analyzing it using R.

This repository includes both printable instructions in PDF files
([`lab_02_report_part_1.pdf`]('lab_02_report_part_1.pdf')
and 
[`lab_02_worked_examples.pdf`]('lab_02_worked_examples.pdf')
) 
and Markdown versions that you can read online on
GitHub ([`lab_02_report_part_1.md`](lab_02_report_part_1.md)
and 
[`lab_02_worked_examples.md`](lab_02_worked_examples.md)).

## Part 2:

Part two is more like a homework exercise in which you will work some problems 
from _Global Warming: Understanding the Forecast_ on layer models of the 
greenhouse effect. You have the choice to do this either the traditional way, 
using paper, or you can get extra practice with R and RMarkdown and do it
electronically, using `lab_02_report_part_2.Rmd` as a template, where you 
do the  calculations in R and fill in the answers in the template using 
RMarkdown.

It is your choice which way you want to do the homework and both ways will be
graded the same.

If you do this assignment as a traditional homework assignment, then upload
your homework to Brightspace (there will be assignment where you can turn it
in). If you do it on paper, then take good quality pictures or scans of your
homework, and upload them.

## Instructions:

* Clone a local copy of the repository for this assignment from GitHub.
* In your local repository, answer the exercises in the templates
  `lab_02_report_part_1.Rmd`.
* When you are done, knit your `.Rmd` files into PDF files.
* Use Git to commit your changes (including the edits to the `.Rmd` files
  and the new PDF or Word files) to your local Git repository.
* Push the changes from your local Git repository to GitHub.

  The last changes that you push before the due date (9:00 AM on Wednesday, 
  Feb. 10) will be 
  graded.

**I advise using Git to commit changes frequently as you work and push those 
commits to GitHub.** 
If you are confused about committing and pushing changes,
I have posted detailed instructions on Brightspace.

**I also advise knitting your work frequently** to make sure that you don't 
have errors that will mess up the RMarkdown formatting.

**Remember that to turn in the assignment you need to:**

1. Successfully **knit** `lab_02_report_part_1.Rmd` into a `.pdf` or 
   Word (`.docx`) file. 
   
     If you choose to do Part 2 in RMarkdown instead 
     of on paper, also knit `lab_02_report_part_2.Rmd`. 
     Otherwise you will turn scans or pictures of your paper homework for 
     Part 2 to Brightspace.
2. **Commit** your `.Rmd` (rmarkdown) document **and** the `.pdf` or `.docx` 
   file to your local git repository on your computer.
3. **Push** your local repository to GitHub, so Ms. Best and Prof. Gilligan 
   can see your final results.

**The last version of your work that you have pushed by the deadline is what will be graded.**
You will lose a lot of points if there is not a `.pdf` or `.docx` file with 
results.

As long as there is a knitted file with results, we will be generous with 
partial credit.
