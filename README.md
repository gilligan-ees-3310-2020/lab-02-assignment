There are two parts to this assignment:

## Part 1:

One is more like a homework exercise in which you will work some problems from
_Global Warming: Understanding the Forecast_ on layer models of the greenhouse
effect. You have the choice to do this either the traditional way, using paper,
or you can get extra practice with R and RMarkdown and do it electronically,
using `Lab_02_assignment_part_1.Rmd` as a template, where you do the 
calculations in R and fill in the answers in the template using RMarkdown.

It is your choice which way you want to do the homework and both ways will be
graded the same.

## Part 2:

The second part of the assignment, uses the RMarkdown template, 
`Lab_02_assignment_part_2.Rmd`, which has exercises
for downloading climate data from the internet and using various tools from the
`tidyverse` package to manipulate the data, analyze it, and plot it.
We will spend most of lab working through these exercises, and you will finish
it at home.

This repository includes both printed instructions 
(`Lab_02_assignment_part_2.pdf`) and a version that you can read online on
GitHub ([`Lab_02_assignment_part_2.md`](blob/master/Lab_02_assignment_part_2.md)).

Because the Martin Luther King holiday falls on Monday Jan. 20, the assignment
will be due by the start of class on Friday, Jan. 24, which should give you
plenty of time to complete it and plenty of opportunity to see Prof. Gilligan
or Ms. Best during office hours if you need help.

## Instructions:

* Clone a local copy of the repository for this assignment from GitHub.
* In your local repository, answer the exercises in the templates
  `Lab_02_assignment_part_2.Rmd`.
* When you are done, knit your `.Rmd` files into PDF files.
* Use Git to commit your changes (including the edits to the `.Rmd` files
  and the new PDF files) to your local Git repository.
* Push the changes from your local Git repository to GitHub.

    The last changes that you push before the due date (9:00 AM on Friday, 
    Jan. 24) will be graded.

I advise using Git to commit changes frequently as you work and push those 
commits to GitHub.
I also advise knitting your work frequently to make sure that you don't have 
spelling errors that will mess up the RMarkdown formatting.

**Remember that to turn in the assignment you need to:**

1. Successfully **knit** `Lab_02_assignment_part_2.Rmd` into a `.pdf` or 
   Word (`.docx`) file. 
   
     If you choose to do Part 1 in RMarkdown instead 
     of on paper, also knit `Lab_02_assignment_part_1.Rmd`. Otherwise you will
     turn in Part 1 on paper at the beginning of class on Friday Jan. 24.
2. **Commit** your `.Rmd` (rmarkdown) document **and** the `.pdf` or `.docx` 
   file to your local git repository on your computer.
3. **Push** your local repository to GitHub, so Ms. Best and Prof. Gilligan 
   can see your final results.

**The last version of your work that you have pushed by the deadline is what will be graded.**
You will lose a lot of points if there is not a `.pdf` or `.docx` file with results.

As long as there is a file with results, we will be generous with partial credit.
